53 weeks and 53 projects with the use of different programming languages. Every week I ask ChatGPT4 to give me ideas for project creations. All of these projects are not AI generated.

<center><b><u>WEEK 1: FILTERS</u></b></center>
<br>
<b>Description:</b> Manipulating images with the use of OpenCV (A module for computer vision) and Tkinter's GUIs.<br>
<b>Programming languages used:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li><b>General:</b>Python</li>
  <li><b>Frontend:</b>Tkinter's module</li>
  <li><b>Backend:</b>OpenCV's module (Machine Learning)</li>  
</ul>
<br>
<b>Process:</b><br>
<ul>
  <li>Creating new project in Python, naming it "Filter.py", and importing the following modules: <ul><li><i>from Tkinter import *</i></li>
  <li><i>import cv2</i></li>
  </ul>
  <li>Creating GUI (windows, labels, buttons) with Tkinter</li>
  <li>Creating functions with OpenCv that will be added in the buttons that are created with Tkinter.</li>
  <li>Inside these functions there are different filters codified using openCV. The images that are imported can't be read by the openCV in order to process these images we need to convert these labels into arrays. Once we do that, the images can be manipulated with OpenCV.</li>
  </li>
</ul>
